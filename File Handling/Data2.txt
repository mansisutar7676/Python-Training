Python too supports file handling and allows users to handle files i.e.,
to read and write files, along with many other file handling options, to operate on files.
The concept of file handling has stretched over various other languages,
but the implementation is either complicated or lengthy, but like other concepts of Python,
this concept here is also easy and short.
